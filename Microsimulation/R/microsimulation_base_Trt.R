## In the base model, following is assumed:
## (1) Individual is characterized by age, sex, and risk level
## (2) Individuals in 'high risk' are at a higher risk of developing illness
## (3) Everyone has the same mortality (regardless of sex and age) unless they develop illness
## (4) Sick individuals have higher mortality than the others
## (5) In 'Treatment' scenario, everyone with disease are on the treatment
## (6) Treatment improves utility during sickness but it does NOT recover illness

## ASSIGNMNET ##
## For assignment #1, generate cost and QALY outcomes by risk groups and discuss who would benefit from treatment more or less.

## For assignment #2, revise the assumption of equal mortality and model age- and sex-specific mortality using the data ".xlsx"
## Discuss how the results (Cost, QALY of two scenarios) changes and speculate why
